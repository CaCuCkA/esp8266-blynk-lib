# Blynk IoT LED Controller

This code represents the foundation of an IoT application aimed at controlling an LED using the Blynk platform. The
central theme is to initialize necessary configurations, establish a WiFi connection, set up the LED GPIO, and
communicate with the Blynk server to monitor and control the LED state.

## Blynk Command Handler:

```c
static void
vw_handler(blynk_handler_params_t* params) {
    if (params->argc > 1) {
        char* pend;
        int led_state = strtol(params->argv[1], &pend, 10);
        gpio_set_level(LED_PIN, led_state);
    }
}
```

This function is registered as a handler for the `vw` Blynk command. It reads the command's arguments and, based on the
provided value, sets the state of the LED either to ON or OFF.

## Important Notes

* Replace **_"YourAuthToken"_** with your actual Blynk authentication token.
* Proper error handling, especially around `malloc`, would make this code more robust.
* Before deploying, ensure that you have set up your Blynk application to send the `vw` command to control the LED.
* Refer to the documentation of each library for more detailed information and potential configurations.
