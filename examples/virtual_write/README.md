# Blynk IoT Virtual Write Example

This code demonstrates how to set up an IoT application using the Blynk platform to respond to virtual write commands.
Upon receiving a command for a specific virtual pin, the application inverts its current state and sends it back to the
Blynk platform. The primary objective is to initialize necessary configurations, establish a WiFi connection, listen for
Blynk commands, and reply with an inverted pin state.

## Virtual write Command Handler

```c
static void
vw_handler(blynk_handler_params_t* params) {
    if (params->argc > 1) {
        char* pend;
        int pin = strtol(params->argv[0], &pend, 10);
        int pin_state = strtol(params->argv[1], &pend, 10);
        fflush(stdout);
        printf("Command %s, virtual pin: %d, pin state %d\n", params->command, pin, led_state);
        blynk_send(params->device, BLYNK_CMD_HARDWARE, WAIT, "sii", "vw", pin, !pin_state);
    }
}
```

* This function is triggered when a virtual write `vw` command is received from the Blynk server.
* It extracts the virtual pin and its current state, inverts the pin state, and then sends it back to the Blynk
  platform using the `blynk_send` function.

* `blynk_send` Function: <br>
  The `blynk_send` function is crucial for communicating back to the Blynk platform. It allows the device to send data
  or
  commands to the Blynk server.

## Important Notes

* Replace **_"YourAuthToken"_** with your unique Blynk authentication token.
* Ensure that you have set up your Blynk mobile application or another Blynk client to send virtual write commands to
communicate with this program.
* Remember that this example simply inverts the received state of a virtual pin. You can customize the handler to execute
more complex actions if needed.
