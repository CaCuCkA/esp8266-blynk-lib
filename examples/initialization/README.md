# Initialize Blynk device

This code represents the main structure of a simple IoT application that interfaces with the Blynk platform. The primary
purpose is to initialize device configurations, establish a WiFi connection, and then interact with the Blynk server.

## Important Consideration:

After the device is initialized using `blynk_begin`, all subsequent operations related to Blynk should be performed on
this initialized device. This ensures the operations are consistent with the device's configurations and states as set
up on the Blynk platform.

## Note

Before running the application, ensure to replace **_"YourAuthToken"_** with your actual Blynk authentication token.
Additionally, manage the potential memory allocation errors after the malloc function.
